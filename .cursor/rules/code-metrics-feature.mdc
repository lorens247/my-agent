# Code Metrics Feature Implementation Rules

## Rule 1: Modular Architecture
All code metrics functionality should be implemented in a separate module with clear interfaces to maintain separation of concerns.

## Rule 2: Performance First
Metrics calculations should be optimized for performance, using asynchronous processing where appropriate and avoiding blocking operations.

## Rule 3: Consistent Error Handling
All error cases must be properly handled with descriptive error messages and appropriate fallback behavior.

## Rule 4: Type Safety
Use TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas for all data structures to ensure type safety throughout the application.

## Rule 5: Documentation
All new functions must include JSDoc comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.
